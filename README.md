# Interact App

Mobile application powered by React Native & Expo

## Setup

Make sure to duplicate the `_config.js` file and name it `config.js`. Assign your ip-adress to `endpoint` with port `4000`. For example: `http://192.168.110.174:4000`. Ping `@glenngijsberts` if you want to test the LinkedIn login, otherwise you can leave the other variables empty. Run the commands below:

```bash
# install expo
npm install -g expo-cli

# install dependencies
yarn install

# start
yarn start
```
